### class: `linkedlist`
# Pros and Cons of Linked Lists

## Pros

- **Constant-time Insertions and Deletions**: Linked lists offer constant-time insertions and deletions in any position. In contrast, arrays require O(n) time to perform the same operations, as they may need to shift elements to accommodate changes.

- **Dynamic Size**: Linked lists can expand dynamically without the need to specify their size ahead of time. Unlike arrays, which may require resizing or reallocation of memory when reaching capacity, linked lists can grow seamlessly.

## Cons

- **Access Time Complexity**: Accessing an element in a linked list requires O(k) time, where k is the distance from the head of the list to the kth element. In contrast, arrays provide constant-time operations for accessing elements, as elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.

### Classes

#### `DoublyLinkedListNode`

- **Description**: Represents a node in a doubly linked list, which contains a value along with references to the next and previous nodes.
- **Attributes**:
  - `value`: Holds the value of the node.
  - `next`: Points to the next node in the linked list.
  - `prev`: Points to the previous node in the linked list.

#### `SinglyLinkedListNode`

- **Description**: Represents a node in a singly linked list, which contains a value along with a reference to the next node.
- **Attributes**:
  - `value`: Holds the value of the node.
  - `next`: Points to the next node in the linked list.

### Considerations

Linked lists are suitable for scenarios where frequent insertions and deletions are required and the size of the data structure may vary over time. However, they may not be ideal for applications that require fast random access to elements, as this operation is less efficient compared to arrays.

When choosing between singly and doubly linked lists, consider the specific requirements of your application. Doubly linked lists offer bidirectional traversal and can support operations like reverse traversal and deletion of the last element more efficiently. Singly linked lists, on the other hand, require less memory overhead per node and may be simpler to implement in certain scenarios.
